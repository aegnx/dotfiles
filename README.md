# aegnx's dotfiles

hello, here are my dotfiles (still in progress, i can make folders now thanks to glocean aka colgate)

its basically my own implementation of catppuccin macchiato (the colors may be inconsistent, but i like them this way)

I took inspiration from kaizen's [dotfiles](https://github.com/kzndotsh/dotfiles)

this is JUST i3, st/alacritty, polybar, and a picom fork config

the gtk theme is located down there!

ok lets go

# PREREQUISITES

pijulius' old picom fork branch, at [pijulius/picom/tree/implement-window-animations](https://github.com/pijulius/picom/tree/implement-window-animations)

download it as a zip file and then unzip it into a folder, then use ninja and meson according to the instructions (instructions in the github link above)

i3wm, polybar, nitrogen/feh (i use nitrogen), "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font" (or any nerd font, you just gotta change config strings)

you can use [getnf/getnf](https://github.com/getnf/getnf) to get your nerd fonts!

GTK themes

[GTK4 (i used Catppuccin-Dark-Macchiato-BL-MB.zip)](https://www.pling.com/p/1715554/) and [GTK3 (you can install them yourself if ur not on gentoo ig)](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Catppuccin)

# INSTALLATION
just git clone them into your home dir and copy the files you want/need:

``git clone https://github.com/aegnx/dotfiles && cd dotfiles``

for example:

``mkdir ~/.config/picom/ && cp ~/dotfiles/config/picom/picom.conf ~/.config/picom/picom.conf``

also for firefox install firefox color and then click on [this link](https://color.firefox.com/?theme=XQAAAAJLBAAAAAAAAABBqYhm849SCicxcUcPX38oKRicm6da8pG5gi-DrbS7fiEFLUzDsWXWyUHMSkHZ2PpRK_LvZGTF44fp7V5-cUx_CRWg2U9gmLkHa_313BCAGaH0etQy5IDqEypDDGgyXZnKOO6rerjp6uJVar6vLqkJlaKgAL7TZSmhjIVSgi1fc_TGPaqj72HtveSwtxc49EFc47CD4NtEh-wVu8Qva-F9aU5d8UVxGK8ZrSvy8Cu5Na0acCM4yAk5sWz7z56b5Et_wAIo5_htC7z04Qb8mrqjQ0mvSJjN383bE3sLcNrK2pC1kzaaa3OyZ6gdEUU-MHeistQ_7r4TgZ_Qy2FD-Jc1kCtpDw7LpX7zFGBSUeN206CLiHgsTE2fs-v6bGfVa415V6rTc0AxXLP9VV5lEteRxEwW5DhJ6499EAUdQhm9V6vV85qbZiUkSpU8x4R5lga8L3lYF6JuWz6d49ZqdLqlRqxwrIIDM0HNlV9_I9nDPSDjS1lWbVarH6GCtBGeeyt-F7BafpB7rZnyzBHpHn914wYe1IdSNLIKPAX83djec76bOEERqP_5hVuf)
